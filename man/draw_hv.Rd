\title{Draw Horizontal/Vertical Lines}
\usage{
draw_hv(h = NULL, v = NULL, l = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{h}{A vector with the y-axis positions
for horizontal lines.}

\item{v}{A vector with the x-axis positions
for vertical lines.}

\item{l}{The lower and upper coordinates to determine
the length of the line (if \code{y} is not \code{NULL},
\code{l} is taken as the x-axis coordinates; if
\code{x} is not \code{NULL}, \code{l} is taken as
the y-axis coordinates).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be
passed to the \code{\link[graphics]{segments}}
function.}

\description{
Draws horizontal or vertical lines on an
existing figure.

\examples{
# Create a blank plot
plot_blank()

# Draw horizontal line
draw_hv(h = .5, lty = 2)
# Draw vertical line
draw_hv(v = .5, lwd = 2)

# Control width of horizontal line
draw_hv(h = .25, l = c(.25, .75), col = "blue")
# Control height of vertical line
draw_hv(v = .25, l = c(.25, .75), col = "orange")
